# collidingBlocksProducingDigitsofPi

Program which tries to recreate 3blue1brown's animation of blocks colliding inelastically and it recreating the digits of pi.
The furthest this simulation can go is 314, which is from a 1 unit mass and a 10,000 unit mass colliding. Higher than that and the counting goes haywire.
